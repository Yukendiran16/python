"""Here, we have created an iterator x_iterator with type <class 'list_iterator'>,
 out of the iterable [1, 2, 3] with type <class 'list'>. This iterator can be thought
 of as a stream of integers coming one after the other. To access the integers,
 we use the built-in next() method to iterate through it, one value at a time.
 Once accessed, the integer is removed from the stream, and the iteration count is
 stored as an internal variable, which allows the iterator to remember its place
 when the next() method is called again. Once the iteration is finished,
 it raises a StopIteration exception, since all the elements have been removed.
 This means the iterator can be traversed only once.Indeed, a for loop is a type of iterator.
 Before a for loop is executed, an iterator object is created in the background,
 then the iteration is performed until the StopIteration exception arises."""
